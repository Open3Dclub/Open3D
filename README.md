# Open3D - www.open3d.club

Our goal is to make an open library of 3D printable objects, and you can check out our idea described in detail (DraftDoc.pdf) on this repository. Basic version of our website www.open3d.club  is up and runing, and source code with copule of 3Dmodels is availble in the folder above. Beside that we have also made promotional video with graphical explanations of how website should be developed in the near tearm https://youtu.be/jzDHj4CEmQQ. 

Professional background of our team is 3D modelling, CNC milling, architectural designing, project management and presentation. We are looking for help from open-minded software developmen and web designers willing to contribute and collaborate with professionals from other fields to develop www.open3d.club concept. 

We have made 3D prize page (http://open3d.club/Prize/index.php) as a place to announce bounties for website development. Programmers and software developers who solve the first set of problems will take over the IT part of the platform and get in charge of future development.

Hope we can work together on this project. Contact us on open3dclub@gmail.com
