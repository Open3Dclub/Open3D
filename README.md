# What is Open3D.club?

At the moment Open3D is just an idea, a showcase of what we intend to do. It is supposed to be a platform where anyone with an internet connection can access or contribute to a library of 3d printable objects. On top of the platform we want to enable a fee based service where chosen 3d models can be printed by professionals. Open 3D is about inventing a business model where all incentives to participate in project are highly aligned with BTC network values. We aspire to measure added value of contributors to the project and reworded their help according to previously defined rules. Down to it’s core, idea of Open3D Club is about sharing content over the internet by following a free software and cypherpunk ideas.  

# Team

Professional background of our team is 3D printing & modelling, CNC milling, architectural designing, project management and project presentations so naturally we are entering this discussion from that point of view. We have chosen to work on the library of 3D printable models because we think that our insights in additive manufacturing industry directions are deep enough, and we can anticipate different phases on the industry’s road map.

# Development Process

The current status of 3D Printing industry, unlike music, photography or movie industries, is immature and in its infancy which gives us enough time to think through and discuss all potential issues. In order to find the best ways to develop Open3DClub, our team is looking for help from open-minded people who are willing to contribute and collaborate with each other in 3D modelling, software development, web design, structural design, production and all other necessary fields.Many features on this platform are yet to be built and developed. 
In order to start a development process we have came up with a system of bounties on 3D Prize page (http://open3d.club/Prize/index.php). Programmers and software developers who solve the first set of problems will take over the IT part of the platform and get in charge of future development.

# Summary

To jumpstart this project we want to initiate a debate about the best and the most efficient ways to achieve decentralization of production through 3D printing and internet sharing. We cannot emphasize enough that this has to be a joint effort of many different groups of people having a wide range of various skills. All contributions will be respected and rewarded. Self-involvement of enthusiasts and their mutual cooperation is the only way to constantly evolve and improve Open 3D Club in the coming years. Hope we can work together on this project.
