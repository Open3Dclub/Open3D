# Open3D - www.open3d.club
We want to make an open library of 3D printable objects, and you can check out our idea in DraftDoc.pdf on this repository or
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzBq8bizE2TcdExEUXAzQ1ZDS2s on this link.

Basic version of www.open3d.club  is up and runing. Beside that we have also made promoutional video with explanations how websit shold work and function in the near tearm https://youtu.be/jzDHj4CEmQQ. Source code is availble on https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzBq8bizE2TcNEFFay1Nd0IxRlk because we didn't know how to upload it properly on GitHub.

Professional background of our team is 3D modelling, CNC milling, architectural designing, project management and presentation. We are looking for help from open-minded software developmen and web designers willing to contribute and collaborate with professionals from other fields to develop www.open3d.club concept. 

We have made 3D prize page (http://open3d.club/Prize/index.php) as a place to announce bounties for website development. Programmers and software developers who solve the first set of problems will take over the IT part of the platform and get in charge of future development.

Hope we can work together on this project
