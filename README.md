Professional background of our team is 3D modelling, CNC milling, architectural designing, project management and presentation. We are looking for help from open-minded software developmen and web designers willing to contribute and collaborate with professionals from other fields to develop www.open3d.club concept.

We have made 3D prize page (http://open3d.club/Prize/index.php) as a place to announce bounties for website development.Programmers and software developers who solve the first set of problems will get in charge of the IT part of the platform.

Hope we can work together on this project
